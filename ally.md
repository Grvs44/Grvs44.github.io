title: Elli's Trans+ Ally Guide
---

Below are some ideas for if you'd like to reinforce your allyship to trans+ people!
If you know any trans+ people, also check in with them to listen to their ideas - these are just a starting point!

- Please don't make comments about gender dysphoria-related things, like appearance, voice, or height (we don't need reminding!) unless you've checked it's okay
- Check in to see how we're doing every now and then, especially if there's been something bad happen
- If you want to learn more and keep up-to-date with the issues trans+ people face, you can subscribe to [QueerAF's newsletter](https://www.wearequeeraf.com) sent every Saturday.
  I like this newsletter as it makes often really bad news much more digestible, while also providing stories of hope and love.
  It's written and run by LGBTQ+ journalists, a majority of which are trans+, making its stories much more reliable than mainstream media
